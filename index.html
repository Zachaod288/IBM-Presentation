        <!-- First paragraph and picture-->
        <div class="col-6"> <div id="header">Company History</div> <p class="withpic">IBM has been a staple in technology for the past century and to this day retains a globally recognisable status. IBM has consistently produced products which have been considered a first of a kind and are regarded as being pioneers in the information industry. The inception of The International Time Recording Company (ITR) in 1889 marked the first step in IBM’s eventual global takeover with its introduction of the time recording clocks to manage employee shift times. After this, the founders of ITR and the Computing Tabulating Recording Company (CTR) realised the potential of using these machines to record more than just employees, but rather store data on companies products, record sales, and other uses. From the realising of the potential of storing vast amounts of data with machines, the information industry was born and IBM was founded in 1911. Since then, IBM has consistently produced both hardware and software with the capability of solving distinct and unique problems decade after decade. For example, in 1952 the IBM 709 computer was lauched, which was the first mass-produced vacuum computer. Following its predecessor, the IBM 7090 was introduced in 1959 which was one of the first fully transistorised mainframes and was capable of performing 229,000 calculations per second. </p> </div>

        <!-- Recent dev and pictures -->
        <div class="col-12"> <div id="header">Recent Developments</div> <p class="intipara">In recent years, IBM has expanded their area of expertise by investing in researching new technologies. For example, IBM has developed an Artificial Intelligence persona, Watson, to undertake an assortment of different functions such as Speech to Text, Language Translator, Advertising Conversations, and many more. With a staggering 70% of global banking institutions using Watson, it shows artificial intelligence has become exceedingly prominent in industry over recent years and research into this field is still in its early stages. The potential for artificial intelligence to flourish is immense and at IBM, this potential is becoming a reality.  </p>
        <p class="withpic"> IBM has also developed IBM Q and the Quantum network, which is a recent innovation that allows developers to access qubits via cloud technology making it accessible to the public. This is also aided by its stylish presentation and added features such as showing the real and imaginary parts in the quantum bell state, and visualising both the probabilities and Bloch sphere of the system. </p>

        <!-- Why IBM -->      <!-- class=gradrole could cause problems-->
        <div class="col-12"> <div id="header">Why IBM?</div> <p class="intipara"> Looking at IBM’s history and its recent developments, it is evident that IBM has consistently managed to develop new solutions and technologies to solve a wide range of problems in a vast array of industries. IBM has always been at the forefront of researching and developing cutting edge technology and shows no signs of slowing down. As an aspiring software engineer, working at IBM would give me the opportunity to gain proficiency in the coding languages I already know, and pursue new languages and technologies in a wide range of fascinating fields. The possibilities for growth are endless at IBM and I would be proud to work for a company that has persistently demonstrated excellence by offering ingenuous solutions in a wide scope of fields. </p>
        <p class="gradrole"> As well as this, IBM are renowned for creating large pieces of software such as its cloud and cognitive software which require the collaboration of a wide range of software developers from a variety of different backgrounds. For me, this presents the chance to cooperate and learn from more experienced coders and further develop my skillset whilst applying it to software which is used by millions of clients.  </p>

        <!--Career ambitions -->
        <div class="col-12"> <div id="header">Career ambitions</div> <p class="intipara">Since being at university, I have developed a keen interest for coding when I discovered how rewarding writing a successful piece of code can be. During my time at university, I have predominantly gained experience with Backend languages and technologies. However, since graduating I have taken steps to learn multiple Frontend languages and apply them to projects, and have plans in place to learn about databases in the learn in the near future.  My long-term goal is to gain the insight to become a Fullstack Developer and I believe IBM is the perfect place to achieve this goal as the graduate scheme offers training in all the necessary areas needed to learn the skills required in the Fullstack, as well as having a library of IBM certified courses to hand. </p>
        <p class="intipara">As a Mathematical Physics student, there has been multiple opportunities to develop my knowledge of Python through taking up optional coding modules in data management and modelling physical systems. These modules involve libraries using Scipy to solve differential equations, Pandas to manipulate large datasets of wave amplitudes and frequencies, Matplotlib to visualise the motion of particles, and many more. These optional modules inspired me to further develop my knowledge of computer science outside of my university. I have partaken in Hackathons with groups of strangers which allowed me to practice learning new technologies and libraries in restricted conditions and timeframes, as well as allowed me to work in a team to produce a common product by sharing coding experiences.</p>
        <p> My initial approach to learn Frontend coding languages involved enrolling onto a course on Coursera Titled “HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers”. As a result of this, I am currently talking to a client about creating a website for them to display homemade crafts and practicing making webpages as seen in this presentation. On top of this, I am currently enrolled onto a course titled “Java Programming: Solving problems with Software” as I feel Java is essential to understand for the vast majority of software developers and plan on enrolling onto “Data Science Fundamentals with Python and SQL” which is taught by IBM to help further broaden my knowledge of computer science.</p>
